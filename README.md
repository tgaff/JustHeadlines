# why?
This project was created in answer to questions like: 

- What good are these hashes?
- Why are we learning to use JSON APIs?  
- What could we do with this?
- What's the big picture?

# slowness
Note that this site will be somewhat slow because we're hitting both APIs sequentially everytime someone searches.  
Ordinarily I might save the data off and request it intermittently.  However, in the interest of keeping the code simple and making it easier to understand; I'm leaving it as is.
